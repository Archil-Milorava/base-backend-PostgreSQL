This code has authorization and authentication with jwt and very simple user model, if you would like to have the authentication code in advance you can use this.

The project needs to have some dependencies installed in order to work, like Resend for sending emails or some other librarys, which have to be installed. This list is of course availble in package.json, so you should be careful with it.
